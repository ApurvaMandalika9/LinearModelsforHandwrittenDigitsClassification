# Linear Models for Handwritten Digits Classification

Implemented the binary logistic regression model and multi-class logistic regression model on a partial dataset from MNIST. 

In this classification task, the model will take a 16Ã—16 image of handwritten digits as inputs and classify the image into different classes. For the binary case, the classes are 1 and 2 while for the multi-class case, the classes are 0, 1, and 2.

- LogisticRegression.py
  Sigmoid - Implemented batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent in the functions fit BGD, fit SGD and fit miniBGD, respectively.
  
- LRM.py
  Softmax- Implemented mini-batch gradient descent in the function fit miniBGD.

Trained the softmax logistic classifier and the sigmoid logistic classifier using the same data until convergence and compared these two classifiers.
